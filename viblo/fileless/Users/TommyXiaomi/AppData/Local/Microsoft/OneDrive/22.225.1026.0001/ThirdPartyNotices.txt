LIBFREETYPE v2.6.1

    The  FreeType 2  font  engine is  copyrighted  work and  cannot be  used
    legally  without a  software license.   In  order to  make this  project
    usable  to a vast  majority of  developers, we  distribute it  under two
    mutually exclusive open-source licenses.

    This means  that *you* must choose  *one* of the  two licenses described
    below, then obey  all its terms and conditions when  using FreeType 2 in
    any of your projects or products.

      - The FreeType License, found in  the file `FTL.TXT', which is similar
        to the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces
        you  to  explicitly cite  the  FreeType  project  in your  product's
        documentation.  All  details are in the license  file.  This license
        is  suited  to products  which  don't  use  the GNU  General  Public
        License.

        Note that  this license  is  compatible  to the  GNU General  Public
        License version 3, but not version 2.

      - The GNU General Public License version 2, found in  `GPLv2.TXT' (any
        later version can be used  also), for programs which already use the
        GPL.  Note  that the  FTL is  incompatible  with  GPLv2 due  to  its
        advertisement clause.

    The contributed BDF and PCF drivers  come with a license similar to that
    of the X Window System.  It is compatible to the above two licenses (see
    file src/bdf/README and  src/pcf/README).  The same holds  for the files
    `fthash.c' and  `fthash.h'; their  code was  part of  the BDF  driver in
    earlier FreeType versions.

    The gzip module uses the zlib license (see src/gzip/zlib.h) which too is
    compatible to the above two licenses.

    The MD5 checksum support (only used for debugging in development builds)
    is in the public domain.

                        The FreeType Project LICENSE
                        ----------------------------

                                2006-Jan-27

                        Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
              David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg

    Introduction
    ============

      The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
      some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
      various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
      FreeType Project.

      This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
      which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
      affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
      documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

      This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
      (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
      and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
      alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

        o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
          interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

        o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
          full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

        o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
          it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
          somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
          FreeType code. (`credits')

      We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
      software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
      We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
      assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


      Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
      credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
      encourage you to use the following text:

       """
        Portions of this software are copyright � <year> The FreeType
        Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
       """

      Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
      actually use.


    Legal Terms
    ===========

    0. Definitions
    --------------

      Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
      and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
      distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
      Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
      beta or final release.

      `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
      `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
      code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
      This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
      engine'.

      This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
      FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
      documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
      original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
      If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
      this license, you must contact us to verify this.

      The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
      Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
      specified below.

    1. No Warranty
    --------------

      THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
      KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
      WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
      BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
      USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

    2. Redistribution
    -----------------

      This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
      irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
      display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
      sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
      forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
      authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
      herein, subject to the following conditions:

        o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
          (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
          the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
          documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
          original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
          files.

        o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
          states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
          FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
          encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
          documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

      These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
      the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
      our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
      to us.

    3. Advertising
    --------------

      Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
      the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
      purposes without specific prior written permission.

      We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
      following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
      or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
      `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

      As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
      accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
      material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
      authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
      Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
      Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
      of this license.

    4. Contacts
    -----------

      There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

        o freetype@nongnu.org

          Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
          future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
          If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
          haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

        o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

          Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
          specific licenses, porting, etc.

    These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
    not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to

    Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name

    ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
    sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
    ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
    by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
    that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
    ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
    of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
    the foregoing paragraphs do.

    The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
    It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
    The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
    ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
    by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

    It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
    patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
    legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
    support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
    (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
    Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
    So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
    code.

    The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
    To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
    been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
    "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
    resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
    GIF decoders.

    We are required to state that
        "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
        CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
        CompuServe Incorporated."

LIBXKBCOMMON v0.4.1

    The following is a list of all copyright notices and license statements which appear in the xkbcommon source tree.

    If making new contributions, the first form (i.e. Daniel Stone, Ran Benita,
    etc) is vastly preferred.

    All licenses are derivative of the MIT/X11 license, mostly identical other
    than no-endorsement clauses (e.g. paragraph 4 of The Open Group's license).

    These statements are split into two sections: one for the code compiled and
    distributed as part of the libxkbcommon shared library and the code
    component of all tests (i.e. everything under src/ and xkbcommon/, plus the
    .c and .h files under test/), and another for the test data under test/data,
    which is distributed with the xkbcommon source tarball, but not installed to
    the system.

PCRE v8.39

    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------

    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data
    in the testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

    The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a
    just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These
    are both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

SQLite

    SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. See http://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html, which states:

    SQLite Copyright


    SQLite is in the
    Public Domain
    All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

    The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.

    All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

    Obtaining An Explicit License To Use SQLite

    Even though SQLite is in the public domain and does not require a license, some users want to obtain a license anyway. Some reasons for obtaining a license include:

    You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the public domain.
    You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the right of an author to dedicate their work to the public domain.
    You want to hold a tangible legal document as evidence that you have the legal right to use and distribute SQLite.
    Your legal department tells you that you have to purchase a license.
    If you feel like you really have to purchase a license for SQLite, Hwaci, the company that employs the architect and principal developers of SQLite, will sell you one.

    Contributed Code

    In order to keep SQLite completely free and unencumbered by copyright, all new contributors to the SQLite code base are asked to dedicate their contributions to the public domain. If you want to send a patch or enhancement for possible inclusion in the SQLite source tree, please accompany the patch with the following statement:

    The author or authors of this code dedicate any and all copyright interest in this code to the public domain. We make this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of our heirs and successors. We intend this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights to this code under copyright law.
    We are not able to accept patches or changes to SQLite that are not accompanied by a statement such as the above. In addition, if you make changes or enhancements as an employee, then a simple statement such as the above is insufficient.
